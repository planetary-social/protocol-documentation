# RPC

A list of known RPC messages.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

This documentation refers to the side sending the initial request as the
client. The side receiving the initial request is called a server. Therefore
for example a phrase "server termination" refers to messages sent by the server
in order to terminate a stream initiated by an incoming request.
